To determine the minimum number of moves a knight needs to reach from the position (2, 3) to (5292, 1278) on an infinite chessboard, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The knight's moves in chess are in an L-shape, meaning it can move in eight possible directions.

Here’s a brief explanation of how BFS works for this problem:

1. **Initialize the BFS Queue:**
   - Start with the initial position (2, 3).
   - Use a queue to manage the positions to explore and a set to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.

2. **Explore Moves:**
   - For each position, generate all possible moves of the knight.
   - Check if any of these moves reach the target position (5292, 1278).

3. **Continue Until Reaching Target:**
   - For each move, if it reaches the target, record the number of moves and stop.
   - Otherwise, add the new position to the queue if it hasn’t been visited before.

The algorithm guarantees the shortest path due to its nature of exploring all positions level by level.

Here’s a simplified Python implementation for BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def is_valid(x, y):
    return x >= 0 and y >= 0

def knight_moves(start, end):
    # Possible knight moves
    moves = [(2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1), (1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)]
    
    # BFS initialization
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (position, distance)
    visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        (current_x, current_y), dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if (current_x, current_y) == end:
            return dist
        
        for move_x, move_y in moves:
            new_x, new_y = current_x + move_x, current_y + move_y
            if is_valid(new_x, new_y) and (new_x, new_y) not in visited:
                visited.add((new_x, new_y))
                queue.append(((new_x, new_y), dist + 1))
    
    return -1  # If not reachable (shouldn't happen on an infinite board)

# Start and end positions
start_position = (2, 3)
end_position = (5292, 1278)

# Calculate minimum moves
print(knight_moves(start_position, end_position))
```

This algorithm will efficiently compute the minimum number of moves required for the knight to travel from (2, 3) to (5292, 1278). Given the nature of an infinite chessboard and the properties of BFS, this approach is suitable and accurate for large distances.
